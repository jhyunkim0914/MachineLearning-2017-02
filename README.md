Research For Movie Raiting Estimation System
Using machine learning and movie information
=====================================
Introduction
-------------
Most people get information about movies on the Internet. People evaluate about the movie they saw, and movie site recommends movies that the customer likes based on their grade. One of the company that makes this system is Netflix. Netflix designs algorithms not only for elements such as popular personalization but also for diversity. It does not only stay in the contents that the user mainly watches but also continues to uncover the content that the user can watch and enjoy. This company also consider about when to show recommended movies for user. If they recommend them too quickly, you may be confused, and if they recommend it too slowly, you might think that you think there is nothing to see. They also care about the language of user and the culture of each country. We can experience this system named ‘Watcha’ in Korea. So, for recommend movies that people don’t see, I want to make the most efficient movie rating estimation system using the information available I can get through this project.
